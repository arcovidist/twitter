@soupvector @Tuliodna 
I don't agree with the former - it's reasonable to describe the 'normal' ticking of the clock (i.e., the avg. subs rate) as being somewhat slow, however, the emergence of novel variants violates the clock. The subs rate also totally ignores indels and recombinations.

="It's a slippery sucker", which means we need to keep driving numbers down using effective and targeted nonpharmaceutical interventions (facemasks, distancing, screening, working from home, etc), while increasing vaccinations - critically, not just in rich countries like the US.

If you think SARS-CoV-2 is a slowly evolving virus, think again. Pretty mind blowing finding from @Tuliodna and colleagues on a new novel variant in three travelers from Tanzania.

Yes, yes, I looked into that too, but that's immensely solvable. As you know, if we melt the poles and Greenland, sea level will rise and make the big boat float right out.

Problem solved.

That's good 😆.

But seriously, why don't they just put more water in the canal? I researched this option carefully (Google), and it's guaranteed to work - the boat will float right out.

Wow, that is a whole lot of nonsense - really shows how these claims are based on a total lack of even the most basic understanding of the science. In addition - so much misrepresentation of the work at the WIV (e.g., GOF was in the US; data are shared, etc.)

Thanks for sharing!

Pandemics are (relatively) uncommon, however, emergence events are not. "Exposures" (that do not necessarily result in onward transmission) to known and novel pathogens are very very very frequent. The same is not true for lab exposures.

Yes, I find this deeply problematic - looking at the caliber of the scientists tweeting and retweeting this, with, what appears to me, little thought or consideration.

Many recent examples of high-caliber scientists posting very questionable information in support of lab leak.

Not that it really matters to this particular discussion - these viruses are clearly distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 (and I'm sure they'll share the genomes when/if they get them fully sequenced).

Getting a full genome - if at all possible - can take a long time. Often, very low levels of virus material from bats - we have done similar work: https://t.co/zqLXmSS6Kf.

They also appear to have partial spike sequences, but again, no genomes.

Still, these are very distant. https://t.co/qDigXg2WK7

These? They're clearly fragments and very distantly related. I expect these might well be the 8 sequences  Zhengli mentioned in the addendum.

Once we start talking about mines, scientists covering up work, and large-scale conspiracies, we're not being scientific.

An important note. I deeply dislike calling individuals out, however, this person has called out so many other scientists in the past that I found it appropriate and necessary.

You may read this article and come to different conclusions than me, but it's emblematic of the issue.

So to your point about being "open minded" and "a good scientist", I think it's important we also remember that that includes being skeptical and ensuring that we scrutinize the data and sources that we base our conclusions on.

To the claims about hidden viruses in a Mojiang mine and the mystery of RaBtCoV/4991 (the sample - RaTG13 being the virus when it got fully sequenced). It's all in the paper - data, the links to the mine, the  studies investigating illness in miners, etc.

What we found was the opposite - all available data pointed to a natural original of SARS-CoV-2👇. That, also, is still true today. 

In fact, since writing our paper, very significant additional data has come forth supporting a natural origin.

@NathanGrubaugh @dmaccannell @ScottGottliebMD 
Yeah, sorry, should have clarified. The reason why I think E484K should be an MOC has little to do with its increasing frequency, and more with the multiple lines of evidence that it's a problematic mutation. Lineage matters, but I think any lineage with E484K needs tracking.

I expect _some_ of the rise of B.1.526 is driven by reinfections - however, we have no direct evidence of that and, importantly, they may be less severe on average (although, we also don't have any direct evidence to answer that question).

@NathanGrubaugh @dmaccannell @ScottGottliebMD 
Agreed - B.1.525 doesn't appear to be doing much. B.1.526 is another story and we probably need to start considering E484K to be a Mutation of Concern.

@arambaut 
Ah, yes, remember that blog post - it's pretty key to this question! I proposed a version of this model when I visited in 2014 with two different hosts - bats and apes - each having different rates to explain this phenomena.

I think people had some issues with this idea though? https://t.co/K4guu1ygxp

While puzzling, I think we may have seen ever more extreme examples in the past, we just didn't realize it at the time.

2014 Ebola outbreak in DRC had a very slow rate, connecting back to outbreaks thirty years prior. Could that also have been a relapse?

@pathogenomenick @ArisKatzourakis 
Assuming the observation is indeed real (I think it is), I think it's a combination of factors. The largest of those might reside outside the spike mutations and has to do with interferon suppression / lowering innate responses (nsp6?). The other, increased receptor binding.

Final point - if we let the virus continue to circulate widely, all bets are off. We'll continue to see severe (local?) outbreaks and new variants will emerge - selection for transmission and immune evasion.

Key points: (1) I don't believe all reinfections will be "mild" or "common cold like". While on average milder, I think there'll be a large spread and new variants will further erode that. (2) There will be many people that can't or won't be vaccinated.

@WilliamBHoenig @stgoldst 
Very good summary, and yes, you're correct Will. I believe we absolutely can make SARS-CoV-2 fade into the background (although I doubt it'll ever be "a common cold"), but that'll require continued aggressive action (what you mention) - at least (or, especially) for now.

Yes, I believe we're in full agreement of the path forward. I'm just very concerned that we (the bigger "we"...) are going to lull ourselves into a belief that this is just another recently emerged ccCoV and all will automatically be well. There's still a lot of hard work to do.

@stgoldst 
I'm not denying that very widespread vaccination, updated boosters, etc. will make this MUCH less of a problem. However, to assume it'll just become a common cold because of that I think is flawed - plus, if true, it'd take a generation.

@stgoldst 
"not an appropriate comparison" - that's exactly my point. The assumption you're making is that SARS-CoV-2 will just become a common cold - and you're looking for evidence to reject that (you can't). However, the key question to ask is the opposite - why do you think it will?

@stgoldst 
Do you have any direct evidence for this? E.g., compare OC43 - leads to common cold in people. Jumps into (naive) apes, also leads to common cold.

SARS-CoV-2 - leads to COVID-19 in both. Also leads to disease in mink, mice (when adapted), etc. OC43 in those animals?

In March 2020, we set up a program to screen firefighters for COVID. A year later, I went back to the fire department to receive a J&amp;J shot, which I was convinced would take &gt;3 years to develop.

Yup, I agree with all those points. When it comes to transmissibility I’m not quite sure it really is more transmissible or whether it got carried along with the surge. Not a criticism of the paper though. 

It soon won’t matter if it is - B.1.1.7 going in for the knockout.

Yes - and I believe we can get it to a much much more manageable level as long as vaccine uptake is (very) high. 

But I think many people confuse “it’ll fade into the background like a common cold if we fight it really hard” vs “it’ll just become another common cold”.

One big reason: variants

We still need to take this seriously.

Yeah, but that’s looking at the average substitution rate, which doesn’t take into account indels, masked sites, and most importantly the ‘jumps’ we saw with the variants. Clearly, the level of antigenic escape we have seen with B.1.351 happened much faster than flu.

I don’t disagree - however the “it evolves much more slowly” isn’t really true. If you look at the VOCs, which from a vaccine perspective would be the main ones to consider (in the short term), those evolved very rapidly.

Here's the preprint on the B.1.429/427 SARS-CoV-2 'variant' first identified in CA.

The conclusions are much toned down compared to what was reported in the media and very preliminary data have been put aside.

Preliminary, but some interesting insights.

It's unclear what exactly the article is saying - but to me it says that SARS2 is likely just a newly emerged OC43. We have no evidence for that and it's a premature conclusion.

To your point, however, I do believe SARS-CoV-2 can fade more into the background. With hard work.

Claim 3 - the virus will become less severe. Again, the evidence we have seen so far show the opposite - e.g., B.1.1.7. That may well change in the future, but the common idea that it'll "evolve towards lower virulence" is context dependent and unsupported by evidence or theory.

Not to be a party pooper, but none of this is supported by evidence - and the three key points are false/unsupported. 

Claim 1 - the virus has reached peak fitness. No data to support that and evidence from e.g., ccCoVs would suggest the opposite. E.g.: https://t.co/eMMi2Gu1xQ

From an immunology perspective, I can see the attraction. However, nothing about SARS-CoV-2 looks like ccCoV to me -whether it be the extreme host- or tissue-tropism, or it's ability to infect damn near any organ. I don't believe the same is true for ccCoVs. Also, SARS. And MERS.

Agreed - in fact, I'm not convinced that whatever it is that makes B.1.1.7 so transmissible is necessarily (exclusively) linked to mutations in the spike. Sure, maybe the spike mutations play *a* role, but are they wholly responsible? I'm not so sure.

Key here is - we have no idea what 'impactful' mutations might look like in a virus that already has E484K - or other mutations.

It's like trying to play million-dimensional chess - and while it's plausible we can checkmate SARS-CoV-2 (with vax), I highly doubt we have. Not yet.

Totally agree - it might be true that SARS-CoV-2 has found a local maxima for fitness, but that landscape ever changing.

Plus, NL63 - while very different - uses ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect very many animals with different ACE2. All tells you it's highly tolerant to mutations.

Yeah - really key to get a sense of the caveats and biases - there are many. Described here: https://t.co/XvTKeIfjPo

Thanks - these numbers should be taken with a massive grain of salt though, as there's a very large bias in the US towards specifically sequencing B.1.1.7. So these numbers are over-inflated. Better estimates of prevalence (although, also not perfect): https://t.co/OGl4wb2vzf

None of these look particularly interesting to me from a VOI/VOC standpoint - we're just looking at normal virus dynamics where things go 📈 and 📉. You could take a bunch of different lineages and they'd look similar - some would rise, some would fall - just expected dynamics.

I'm glad to see @CDCgov making good recommendations.

However, it's key that we communicate that these are *short* term recommendations until we get SARS-CoV-2 under much better control, with larger numbers of people vaccinated. Once we're there, these requirements will relax. https://t.co/ItPwbJztmR

Another knock down paper from South Africa! This time  501Y.V2 (B.1.351) is giving again good news with confirming that neutralise other lineages but also another VOC, the P1.

@Ayjchan @gabbystern @WHO @JamieMetzl Appreciate your concern but am amazed at rejection of results without a look at what was done. By doing so, imho scientists take a political stance. Its a free world, but this topic should not be politicised. Too important, spillovers could happen anywhere, we need to learn

@Ayjchan @MarionKoopmans @gabbystern @WHO @JamieMetzl 
It’s true that there are scientists on that “letter”, however, there are no experts and it’s certainly not “based on science”. In fact, it’s hard to find anybody with relevant experience who signed. Unlike the group established under WHO (all experts with relevant experience).
