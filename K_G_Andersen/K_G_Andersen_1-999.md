Sigh. “Scientists believe if a virus is more transmissible, it tends to be less severe”. Whilst some scientists may believe this, those who study the evolution of virulence (disease severity) generally don’t.

@BenjaminMateus7 
When it spilled over, it is incorrect to say SARS-CoV-2 was "well adapted to humans". We know this because:

1. The emergence of VOCs and human adaptation ongoing
2. The virus can jump between species with no evolution - e.g., mink
3. Pangolin CoVs bind even stronger to hACE2.

Yup - and Dr. Shi also reported that they tested all their bat samples for SARS-CoV-2 - none were positive.

Of course, one can say they're lying or that the tests were faulty...

Just adding this from @amymaxmen - she talked to Baltimore, and turns out he agrees.

I agree the FCS looks unusual at a quick glance - that's why it's so important we look at _all_ the data very carefully before coming to big conclusions.

Yup, and I agree on all of this - however, it gets to my first point - my biggest concern about B.1.617.2 (or B.1.351 for that matter) isn't the B.1.617.2 itself, it's the potential for new VOCs if we don't massively drive down transmission - world-wide, that is.

The issue isn't that we "guessed wrong" - it's still important to have an updated B.1.351 booster in our arsenal.

The issue is that we may now also need a second one - for B.1.617.2.

And so ♾ - unless we focus on majorly decreasing WW transmission so VOCs less likely to emerge

IMO, the biggest concern with B.1.617.2 isn't B.1.617.2, it's the VOCs we haven't seen yet.

We developed updated boosters for B.1.351, which would likely work just as well for P.1. But B.1.617.2 is a different 'class' of VOC, achieving escape in a different way.

A really important study. Of course I am biased, but this really sets the standard for how neutralisation studies should be done. The conclusions are very robust. We are dealing with a significant immune escape variant. A second vaccine more necessary than ever. https://t.co/VvsoRGrmVq

“Rounding low risk down the zero risk” is a good way of putting it, because, yes, it’s never zero but it’s much lower than if not vaccinated.

@ValleyWye @ScottVMeyers 
Agreed. There's nothing telling us the virus itself will become less severe - there seems to be a strong correlation between increased transmission (under selection) ➡️ increased severity (not under selection - either way). However, (much) less severity will come from vaccination

Very likely "better" and the loss of effectiveness for hospitalization / deaths will almost certainly be less severe than loss of effectiveness for symptomatic disease. However, assuming hosp/deaths will be unaffected would be ill-advised IMO.

Agreed. It's definitely concerning - and not so much because of this specific variant, but more so for what we might expect (but can't know) SARS-CoV-2 to do over the next 3-6 months, leading into winter.

No question focus needs to be transmission ⬇️ and worldwide mRNA vax ⬆️.

There's no other way of putting it - this is not good news re. transmissibility, severity, and one-shot vaccination / first-wave immunity.

Importantly though, 2-shot vax (especially mRNA) seems to be holding up very well against Delta (I hear the same from CViSB colleagues). https://t.co/14geXHQyIV

Virus induced fusion of infected cells to one another is fairly common across different virus infections

Measles and RSV are quite famous for this.

Virus induced cell fusion helps the virus replicate while avoiding antibodies.

Correct -the main likelihood here doesn't have to do with the "lab" part, it has to do with finding the virus in the first place and working on it secretly prior to a pandemic you don't yet know will happen. And then all of that leading to a super spreading event at a wet market.

Agreed. The science letter comes from the angle that "there's no data, so we can't say either way". That is false - there is plenty of direct data in support of natural emergence, with no data to the contrary. It's a false equivalence. What we're missing is an intermediate host.

"lab leak can be dismissed" and "both zoonosis and lab leak are viable".

I disagree. We have: "lab leak is unsupported/unlikely, with natural emergence supported by data" and the other: "they're equally likely based on a lack of evidence". IMO, the latter is a false equivalence.

Unclear. I have been quite skeptical about them being a potential intermediate host, but recent data from more pangolins and the molecular data make me believe they could potentially have played a role. It's a maybe - but I think racoon dogs, civets, mustelids, etc. more likely.

This might help - very interesting data from the pangolin CoVs (with near-identical RBD) that bind *human* ACE2 stronger than SARS2.

Strong binding to human ACE2 is nothing unusual at all and SARS2 was definitely not "optimized for human binding".

The restriction site, recombination patterns, and residues could be explained easily - a lot of this was down to us (me) still learning about the vast CoV litterature. The FCS took longer and the RBD took until the pango CoVs. We looked at a lot of other stuff too.

Key background - this was before the full RaTG13 genome and there was hardly any data at the time. Plus, the decade-long research at WIV. With that in mind, the features that we noticed were the RBD, a few other key residues, the FCS, a restriction site, and recomb. patterns.

It's worth pointing out that I and others have said exactly that from day 1 - however, the conspiracies have created a narrative where we all "dismissed it out of hand".

That's absurd and couldn't be further from the truth. It's just that the data don't support the hypothesis.

Because of the attention on COVID-19's origin, many are learning about the mysterious flu season of 1977, the so-called "Russian Flu." It was nearly identical to a 1950's H1N1 strain. It was def not a natural outbreak, but also not likely a lab accident.  https://t.co/PFtgtRa2v6

Just FYI 👇.

And yes - you're invoking a conspiracy to explain the data. In fact, you're doing that right now. Most hypotheses around a potential lab leak are conspiracy theories - given current knowledge, using a strict definition, all are by now.

As I have said many times, we seriously considered a lab leak a possibility.

However, significant new data, extensive analyses, and many discussions led to the conclusions in our paper.

1977 H1N1 - which was a known virus - was _not_ the result of a lab leak, however, it _was_ the result of human error. Specifically, it was likely linked to a failed vaccine trial with people deliberately being infected and then the virus took off in a pandemic.

(Un)lucky coincidence. The coronaviruses identified in pangolins have the same key residues as SARS-CoV-2 and do in fact bind *stronger* to *human* ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2.

I'm pretty sure going back to the Huanan market and tracing things back in time by following the animals (heck, even the money) - with some truly thorough studies - would help provide answers.

That's not happening right now because we're obsessed with a low probability theory.

I have _some_ insights into those early days of sequencing - not pretty, that's for sure.

Yes. Early cases, excess deaths, timing, positive animal cages, generalist virus, co-circulating lineages, serology, no prior evidence of virus, etc.

*The* only thing missing is a confirmed intermediate host - if one exists. Hence the need to "follow the animals".

In case you are interested in the evidence for a SARS-CoV-2 lab leak, here it is clearly presented in a February, 2020 paper.

To this day, the evidence for a lab leak remains the same.

As for WIV and Wuhan, consider this - how likely (or not) was it that Wuhan became ground zero? (with or without lab). Largest city in central China, highly connected, multiple wet markets sourcing from all over China, etc.

Like me you're proud to be a data nerd, right? Now, if we split people into those who inform their priors either on data and evidence or speculation and innuendo, I think you'll observe much less disagreement among people in each group. With beliefs in opposite direction.

Nate, you should really know this - it's critically important to have well-informed priors to answer that question. Do you honestly believe most people - even most scientists - have the required expertise and looked through all the relevant data to have well-informed priors?

Actual wording 👇 - while I can't speak for Govt labs, I have a hunch:

"If our main goal is to truly understand what led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, such studies need to be collaborative and cannot consist of one-sided demands that are unlikely to be met" https://t.co/Al1CBjBSBW

In our experience, high Ct values alone explain &gt;50% - add the rest and I think we easily end up on 95%. We can do better for sure - and we will - but this is incredibly hard work and not simply a question of "putting the sample in the sequencer".

I don't think anybody disagrees on any of this and *none* of us have said "no need to investigate" - it's the complete opposite. However, not all theories are equally likely and there's a huge false equivalence at play. https://t.co/2JLmBEJbq7

None of us have been "opposed to discussing the lab leak hypothesis" (in fact, I was one of the first to bring it up - in January, 2020). We have, however, made it clear that it is a highly unlikely speculative theory that is unsupported by evidence. That remains true today.

It's not the lab leak itself that's highly unlikely - it's everything before, everything after, and the lab leak combined.

SARS escaped once it had been 'pre-selected' for human infectivity and labs were growing high titer viruses. Primary isolate of random virus=very different.

Happy to disagree on this point, but I can't see how it's different - e.g., scientist vs animal trader.

Bacteria are living and just need media to grow - one is enough. Viruses are non-living and need to infect cells and replicate, using host machinery, specific receptors, etc.

@angie_rasmussen @mlipsitch @PeterDaszak 
Yeah, that scenario - which is just a very specific version of natural emergence - is highly unlikely, bordering to impossible.

The virus would also have to have been a) picked from a bat, and b) gotten to a wet market to cause a super spreading event. Combined, hugely unlikely.

Sure, A LOT to find out still so 💯 agree. However, data on early cases and excess deaths = not terrible and highly suggestive as all center around Huanan market. qPCR and sequencing from Huanan = good data and very suggestive.

I think we have to be very careful with this 'intelligence', which was first reported in Australia back in December of 2019 - plenty of red flags. Maybe somebody broke a foot? Maybe somebody had the flu? WIV is a big place and health seeking behavior in China != US.

The final point to make is that lab leaks have happened only with known viruses - 'known' because they can infect humans. Zoonoses 'select' for human infectivity, unlike random sampling from bats, which doesn't - vast majority of bat viruses can't infect human (cells).

This issue is pretty much universal across bat samples - we had a pretty active 'bat' project, but never managed to isolate anything and getting complete genomes was incredibly hard. I assume the same is true at WIV.

To use an example - RaTG13. The genome has low coverage (hence, I assume, it's been updated a few times) = low titer = virtually impossible to grow out (isolate) in tissue culture.

This is the main reason RdRp-based sequencing is used too - near-impossible to get a full genome.

Virus isolate = characterized, however, I think people are *grossly* underestimating how incredibly difficult it is to isolate (grow) a virus out of a primary bat sample. Viruses are typically *very* low titered and samples of poor quality - hence we have very few isolates.

What's interesting here is that this isn't actually ADE - it's a completely different (and very interesting) potential mechanism.

The NTD clearly has a large effect on ACE2 binding (e.g., pangolin CoVs bind *much* stronger to hACE2). But yeah, need in vivo human data.

The issue being that as long as there's a lack of absolute certainty, anybody (ignoring evidence) can conjure up any version that fits a specific agenda- eg US blaming China, China blaming US.

Once we have clarity that goes away, but if we don't get clarity we remain vulnerable.

Ripe for conspiracies - and both ways. My main concern is that we end up in a deadlock where there is *zero* incentive to find out how the virus emerged. Presumably, the current version fits the agendas of China/US quite well - once (if) an intermediate host is found, no more.

@NarangVipin @K_G_Andersen WIV has 600 people （students and employees）. Only 3 people got symptoms and went to see a doctor in a flu season（in China it is so common to see a doctor for cold and get IV antibiotics）. I would say WIV people did a very good prevention work against flu. https://t.co/RVIhiQLfdj

Christophe, as you mention, the absolute SAR values for B.1.1.7 vs B.1.617.2 are very similar (a little lower) than the early non-B.1.1.7 vs B.1.1.7.

So while B.1.617.2 may likely (inherently) be as transmissible as B.1.1.7, maybe the additional increase is due to breakthroughs?

@TimKell91827640 @ChristoPhraser 
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well. 'First wave' natural immunity may have waned enough to be similar to 1-shot vaccination and I think could to a large extend explain the *increased* transmission rate vs B.1.1.7. India, also high 'first wave' immunity.

@ChristoPhraser 
One question on SAR - ~1.6x difference between B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2, which is concerning. But from the vaccine data, we also see ~1.6x difference between the two after 1 shot (50% vs 30% eff).

Maybe increased SAR can to a large extend be explained by higher 1shot breakthroughs?

Worth reading whole thread on new technical briefing below 👇, but one thing that stands out for me is the secondary attack rate (i.e. risk-per-contact) column on right – unlike earlier version, this one compares over same time period, and is noticably higher for B.1.617.2 https://t.co/y1Q56UGPIQ https://t.co/Zd99j1eGDc

Such an interesting (older) preprint showing that the pangolin CoVs with the 'SARS-CoV-2-like' RBD bind *much* stronger to *human* ACE2 than Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 (which itself binds stronger than Wuhan-Hu-1).

Most (all?) of this down to the NTD. 🤔⭐️

What I love about these theses - even in a WIV thesis from 2019, there is zero mention of a virus that could have been SARS-CoV-2.

They're spinning all of this information into a giant web about conspiring Chinese scientists, but actually it provides evidence to the contrary.

Thanks. It's because she's white and kinda limp when you pick her up... Very fitting.

‘Processed’? What does that mean? How many genome dashboards do we need? - strongly recommend https://t.co/H4GpG9oyZK for your variant tracking needs.

1.THREAD on latest Sanger data on B.1.617.2 (new variant of concern).

Remember Sanger use all sequenced cases for England (about 50% all cases) and remove data from travellers and surge testing - so approx community cases.

https://t.co/ugzYFpLhBR

TLDR: nothing encouraging. https://t.co/t8yf6O1HyK

It "seemed" very plausible at the time, however, that's the key - when you do something this dramatic, you better make sure you have some actual evidence to back it up.

50% of the population also finds it very plausible that the 2020 election was stolen. But it wasn't.

Yeah, but a lot of caveats to that data and several odd things suggesting potential (largely unknown) biases.

Sure, definitely bias in this data too - however, if there was a major difference between B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 one might expect to see if already. We don't.

Doesn't mean B.1.617 isn't more transmissible than B.1.1.7, but other data problematic too (likely more so).

Looking back at the early data showing B.1.1.7 was more transmissible than non-B.1.1.7, secondary attack rates were increased across the board. Not so here, suggesting that while B.1.617.2 may be as transmissible as B.1.1.7, it is not more transmissible - at least not in the UK.

A lot of scary looking graphs being shared suggesting  B.1.617.2 may be outcompeting B.1.1.7.

However, many potential confounders in that data and if we instead look at secondary attack rates from the recent PHE report there's no difference between the two. 👇 https://t.co/gZYdsnUQwR

Important study from Denmark investigating reinfection  on a large mink farm during the epizootic last year.

Very high rates of reinfection (~75%) within 3 months.

Key - mink are not humans (🙄), they're stacked in cages, and they don't have vaccines..!

Interesting, albeit very preliminary study suggesting that 
"[in Manaus] reinfection due to P.1 [was] common and more frequent than what has been detected by traditional epidemiologic, molecular and genomic surveillance of clinical cases".

Thanks Richard for confirming that your evidence for the NIH supporting GOF research at the WIV is the 2017 paper and the grant abstract.

As the NIH and others have concluded, none of this is GOF.

FWIW, the chimeric viruses are slightly less infectious if anything. https://t.co/jKDAbej6yW

As Fauci said yesterday, it doesn't matter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it true. You're alleging that the NIH and Fauci are covering up that they funded GOF work at the WIV under an EcoHealth subaward. That allegation needs some hard evidence - otherwise it's libel.

@R_H_Ebright @GigaGerard @Ayjchan 
Your two points are also false - creating 'viruses' that are not present in nature is not GOF. They cloned spike genes from bat coronaviruses into well-established BAC clones and tested ACE2 binding - none led to higher binding. You may disagree with this work, but it's not GOF.

I disagree. You are alleging all of this based on no evidence - "chimeric viruses" can mean a lot of different things. In addition, these viruses are derived from bat coronaviruses and not "SARS viruses" - and certainly not done with the intend to make them more transmissible.

The most comprehensive review of how the world responded to #covid19 and how to prevent the next pandemic was published today.
It will likely be the basis of discussions in coming months and years and so I read it for you.

New data- Using a live virus neutralization assay, the B.1.617.1 variant has 7 fold reduced neutralizing activity compared to the WT virus. But, most convalescent samples and all mRNA vaccinee samples still show neutralizing activity against B.1.617.1.

The same RBD can be found in CoVs from pangolins. What's more, those pangolin CoVs have _higher_ affinity for human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2 (likely due to the diverged NTD).

The devil is indeed in the detail. Many, many, many issues with that piece that I'm not going to get into, but it's worth pointing out that the "mysterious FCS" is the only specific argument put forward to support lab leak in Nick's article. And it's false.

Sure, if you want to ignore all available evidence, I agree. That's why I very seriously considered a lab leak early in the pandemic.

To your logic, we can never know if anything is true.

Variants of 👇 have come up - it's false. Specifically:

1. The events are not independent, hence the calculation is incorrect.

2. It's the same argument used by creationists about "irreducible complexity" - also false:

I honestly don't know either - I think it's because if you have never looked closely at virus evolution it may look unusual. Add in some good 'ole irreducible complexity and you have a 🏆.

As you say - furin sites are hallmark features of HPAIs and we discuss it in our paper🤷.

It doesn't merely "argue", it proves. Baltimore presented a testable hypothesis (the FCS is a "smoking gun"), but didn't look at the data before passing judgement.

Does this disprove a lab leak? No. However, it disproves there being a "smoking gun" in the FCS and lends further evidence to natural emergence - but it also does not *prove* that scenario.

So Baltimore's second point is also false, invalidating his hypothesis that the "FCS [...] with its arginine codons [...] was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus".

Baltimore does not provide any evidence to support his hypothesis and the data support a natural origin. https://t.co/sOqqpeqRk4

R is coded by six different codons, yet the simple single transition "CGA" is only observed in ~0.02% of sequences. The second most 'popular' codon at these sites is "CGT" (a transversion) at 0.11% frequency.

In other words - there is nothing unusual about the codons either.

🚨Remarkably stable. Specifically, CGG is 99.87% conserved in the first codon and 99.84% conserved in the second. 

This is *very* strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 'prefers' CGG in these positions.

One final point about the CGG codons in the FCS - if they were somehow "unnatural", we'd see SARS-CoV-2 evolve away from "CGG" during the ongoing pandemic. We have more than a million genomes to analyze, so what do we find if we look at synonymous mutations at the "CGG_CGG" site?

We see CGG multiple times in different ways - here's an example comparing another "PR" stretch between SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV in the N gene. Note how SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 both use CGG, while SARS-CoV-2 uses CGC for the first R, while later R's are coded by CGT or AGA. https://t.co/BKKyOu5UyN

🚨Furthermore, if we go back to the FCoV sequences and compare them to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide level you'll see that FCoV also uses CGG to code for R immediately following the P. The next R is CGA (non-CpG) in FCoV, while it's CGG in SARS-CoV-2 - one nucleotide difference. https://t.co/zDmjMIZTT6

Now, the codons. Here, Baltimore is talking about the two codons coding for the first two arginines (R) following the P - CGG. The CGG codon is rare in viruses because it's an example of an unmethylated "CpG" site that can be bound by TLR9, leading to immune cell activation. https://t.co/2C5d7Keorm

Importantly, however, in recent month we have started seeing the "P" mutating towards residues creating more optimal furin sites - P681H and, especially, P681R, which can be found in B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.x, suggesting the virus may evolve towards more efficient usage of the site. https://t.co/S1nCxMhYQT

The "P" from the (P)RRAR insert isn't directly part of the cleavage site itself, but, intriguingly, may regulate it via the nearby O-linked glycans.

The (P)RRAR FCS isn't optimal and while it's 'sufficient' for SARS-CoV-2s 'success' as a pandemic virus, it's not an ideal site as defined by the canonical R‐X‐K/R‐R FCS seen in many proteins (viral and otherwise).

How did SARS-CoV-2 acquire the FCS? We don't know, however, we know four main mechanisms often lead to insertions: 

(1) mutation

(2) polymerase slippage

(3) template switching

(4) recombination

All of which play key roles in coronavirus (incl. SARS-CoV-2) evolution.

Wade has a troubled history of misrepresenting (and/or misunderstanding) the very basics of evolutionary biology. I'm not going to get into that, but you can Google it.

Main issue is that he has no relevant expertise in the very difficult area of science he's trying to address.

It's difficult - I totally get it. If I read Wade's article as a lay person, I'd likely come to the same conclusions - it looks well researched and with seemingly compelling arguments.

The problem is - it's not.

Baltimore's quote *is* shocking - however, not because it's true, but because it's wrong. There's nothing mysterious about the FCS or the codons - anybody who'd care to take a close look at the data would realize this. That, admittedly, requires a little more his "first" look.

"Too critical of all virologists"? Not exactly - he's asking the world to blame all virologists (and Chinese scientists, Fauci, the NIH, and many others) for the COVID-19 pandemic and the millions of deaths.

Template switching is key - very likely mechanism for the FCS and Gallaher laid it out &gt;a year ago: https://t.co/C19InZD0RY.

It's a general feature we see from the variants - reversion/addition of charged AAs. I don't understand that - typically such mutations would be detrimental, but it seems like SARS-CoV-2 can tolerate them. 🤷

T19R is particularly interesting to me - could be playing a role in both increasing ACE2 affinity and evade Abs since it's in an epitope "super" site.

Potential ACE2 affinity tweaking this far outside the RBD is interesting - but we have seen it in the pango CoVs.

Yeah, each system has inherent bias - same for CDC classification with US focus. WHO system way out of date.

For now, we'll peg our classifications to one system for simplicity, but as Trevor/Nate say, there's a need to be able to see e.g., CDC labels, which we're working on.

Finally, it is *much* too early to get a good sense of how "concerning" this VOC is - a lot of key data missing at the moment and it'll take time to get.

In the meantime, you can track the variant on https://t.co/O2DFHyBWzl.

In addition, I think we need to start paying more attention to non-Spike mutations. E.g., N, where we're starting to see some interesting patterns too - of unknown importance. Unfortunately, these are much harder to study experimentally. https://t.co/sArFSx9ktQ

And until what I mentioned☝️have been better thought out and thoroughly discussed, we will likely defer to PHE for VOC classification (which also means "CA" variant will be relisted as VOI).

They will - pinged the team this morning. Despite limited data, for B.1.617.2 this is (unfortunately) a pretty easy call.

We're considering setting up an independent (large) international committee under https://t.co/O2DFHyBWzl to vote on classifications. More to come.

Yeah, great paper - however, it lends support to my comment about likely needing to receive updated boosters 6-12 months out to maintain 50% effectiveness against current and emerging variants. 75% effectiveness against B.1.351 in this study shortly after full vaccination.

Terrific data out from Moderna today!

In a small study, they found that in ppl previously vaccinated, a booster specific to a variant (B.1.351) elicited strong antibody responses against the variant.

@EricTopol @CDCMMWR 
What's important here is that these numbers are small and this (potential) increased risk of reinfection *doesn't matter* for individuals - the same likely true for e.g., P.1. It only becomes important at the population level and can explain why e.g., B.1.526 rose in frequency.

@EricTopol @CDCMMWR 
The data is too small for firm conclusions, however, for the reinfection data there's ~2x difference between B.1.526(E484K) and non-B.1.526. The trajectory seen from B.1.526 (prior to B.1.1.7) was consistent with ~30-40% increased rate of reinfection - consistent with this study.

@LauringLab 
Typically I'd 💯 agree with this, but there *are* unfortunately reasons why the lay public need to know about *some* of the variants because they require additional/different mitigation efforts. B.1.1.7 and P.1 come to mind.

It's a very complex issue IMO.

Need to be very careful with interpreting this type of data - the true number of reinfections is likely very underreported. So when we say "6%", the real number is likely significantly higher - by how much, we don't know (maybe ~20-30% of total infections during recent RSA wave?)

Yup - I certainly don't disagree that the data are suggesting that P.1 is growing exponentially -it does. But it's unclear to me if it has an advantage compared to e.g., B.1.1.7 - it might, but I think likely context dependent and other factors may better explain current picture.

Just one example here in San Diego where we have seen growth of P.1 - the vast majority of that 'growth' is due to importations, not local spread. There's _is_ local spread, but a lot of P.1 ⬆️ is driven by those importations.

As P.1 frequency goes up, that'll ⬇️.

I agree with a lot of this, however, we have to be careful about "... faster logistic growth of P.1 compared to B.1.1.7".

We're comparing early growth of P.1, where introductions  play a large role, versus late growth of B.1.1.7 - which we have observed to plateau.

Agreed. I think especially the point about the importance of “consequences of failure” is often forgotten or ignored.  

The evolution of severe VOCs is one example of such a consequence of failure. “Optimism” may very well lead to inaction.

High attack rates during first waves would likely do that - in places with a lot of standing immunity from early waves, I'd expect B.1.351 and P.1 to be (slightly) more competitive than B.1.1.7.

Mostly B.1.1.7. Vaccination likely bringing down the absolute numbers by now, but wouldn't be expected to change relative proportion.

It's likely going down because of competition from other lineages, as well as drift.

A bunch more reasons to get vaccinated: as more and more are immunized, the number of maskless faces on the right of this chart will steadily increase.

The more we can get transmission down and get vaccination up, the more quickly we will get back to "normal" https://t.co/e5SDjd6pQq

Why do I call them the "Debbie Downers" of the immune system? Because they suppress and modulate immunity so it doesn't get too rowdy🥊 (in an effort to protect against autoimmunity).

@BillHanage 
Agreed, although I think it's important we separate out individual vs population effects. Having a lot of partial immunity could ⬆️ the average risk of escape for individual transmissions, *however* if it lowers mutational supply (probably does), the overall effect would be ⬇️.

@zeynep 
I don't really think it matters that this was a "*cluster*" among (old) people "*who live together*". What matters is the fact that we can compare those who were vaccinated vs those who were not - and it comes out the same ➡️ the vaccine is *highly* effective.

Yeah, good point and I missed that part - full approval will take forever. I understand why they do it, but the smarter move is to say that "authorized vaccines will be required to be on campus".

I contacted Zoom in the olden days of pre-COVID telling them that most people couldn't figure out how to "connect to audio" and that it was💩 using five minutes of every call figuring it out.

They told me it wasn't their problem, but rather people being computer illiterate...🤦

Yup. There is also a NEJM paper going around that says absolutely nothing at all about whether vaccination breakthrough is either common or rare - and relationship to severity or variants.

I think almost certainly a combination of waning immunity + immune ‘escape’ variant(s). 

What’s less clear to me is whether we’re also dealing with severe reinfections and possibly even enhancement. Between this, Manaus, and other places, I’m not comfortable saying “no”.

Superb article in @guardian by Prof David Hunter discussing a side of rapid tests too often lost in the media. 

Speed &amp; accessibility are absolutely paramount when testing to slow transmission. False positives are quickly mitigated with repeat testing.

The constellation of mutations is interesting - with many similarities to other VOCs/VOIs, but B.1.617 seems to have found it's own unique evolutionary path.

A lot of talk about B.1.617 first identified in India ("double mutant" - 🙄).

It's an interesting lineage and definitely one to watch.

Unfortunately, not a lot of data shared from India, but we're tracking this VOI on https://t.co/O2DFHyBWzl.

Great to see a strong focus on genomic epidemiology from the @WhiteHouse.

Details to be figured out, but the overall plan looks good, putting @CDCgov in a strong position to continue to lead the build-out of genomic sequencing across the country.

Currently, yes. But the US has been higher in the past (note, these are only reported numbers - which varies based on e.g., volume of testing).

However, a little perspective - in this case comparison to the US - can be helpful.

These plots show 7-day rolling averages of daily cases and deaths.

The situation is dire and immediate action is required in India - however, the US is nowhere near out of this mess yet.

I agree, this is indeed the million dollar question.

However, whatever the answer is, it's *not* just an inherent property of SARS-CoV-2 - we decide the trajectory. 

In a world where there's *much* less transmission, the virus will have fewer opportunities. 

We control that 😷 https://t.co/ow5JjEimnH

Denmark is now doing close to half a million COVID-19 tests a day - most of them rapid antigen tests. That's ~8% of the population - every. single. day.

Is this the key to keeping B.1.1.7 in check? Which they have managed to do so far (and cases are decreasing). https://t.co/Do7xQaH4to

I'm not suggesting hospitals randomly start doing this - what I'm suggesting is whether there might be value in comparing the frequency of anti-PF4 antibodies in well-controlled studies of control vs vaccine(s) vs patients.

2) That said, "6 in 6 million" is not the right way to think about it. It's 6 reported, which might not be all, and it's specific to women 18-48, with a specific timeframe after vaccination. This is a small risk, well under 1-in-10,000 but the specific who-and-when matters. https://t.co/euE1qCSBfd

Random sampling on some 'backyard' pangolins bringing up a ~10% positivity rate for SARS(2)-like viruses is, well, high. In Guangdong (where, of course, SARS broke out).

We focus so much on these viruses being in bats in Yunnan, but I'm wondering if we need to expand our scope.

The potential pool is large... But hey, let's exhaustively sample them all, huh? Easy. 80% power, surely.

@Mahan_Ghafari 
Very concerning. I don't know enough about travel in the region, but Jordan has been dominated by B.1.1.7 for a while now. I believe other VOCs (P.1 and B.1.351) are also starting to circulate.

The kind of spread in Iran looks like P.1 / B.1.351.

Possibly, but similar reports are starting to pop up in e.g., Danish media. Still anecdotal and much more study needed, however, in very old individuals there's reason to believe one dose may not be sufficient.

Single dose of BNT162b2 did not prevent fatal outcomes in this example of a long-term care facility outbreak in Germany.

Most cases occurred three weeks after the dose.

Stark reminder that we need more data on this important topic.

"Being smart" is at the level of our country/state/county response - using all indicators and realizing that it's not just about making sure hospitalizations aren't full. We need multi-layered strategies.

And yes, we can absolutely do more 'normal' things when vaccinated - I do.

I don't think a full escape mutant is on the (near) horizon - the vaccines are ⭐️. However, that's why we need to be smart and drive down transmission (which, the vaccines _will_ help do). But if we see increases in cases -even in the absence of hospitalizations - we need to act.

"Which seems pretty unlikely" - that's the problem. If we have rampant transmission, that "pretty unlikely" is likely going to be "very likely". We already saw what B.1.351 did to AZN - in one single evolutionary jump.

It's playing with fire - and unnecessary if we're smart.

If we have a situation with a lot of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but hospitalizations are fine, it's going to be a temporary state - it won't hold. It gives the virus a tremendous opportunity for evolution and this time specifically to evade our most important tool - vaccines.

I strongly disagree - it's a short sighted plan for a problem in need of a long term strategy.

The plan always should have been to drive community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 down close to zero.

With variants, we can't manage the pandemic at the level of hospitalizations. https://t.co/i94w4wMXuQ

Great to see such strong cross-variant neutralization after vax!

Six patients previously infected with the original #SARSCoV2 virus received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Before vaccination, they had neutralizing activity against the B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but not B.1.351. After one dose, neutralizing activity against all variants increased greatly.

Yup - really need to focus in on the animals and ask some hard questions. A lot to be learned and it is by far the most likely hypothesis.

Somehow a lab escape led to a wet market becoming the early epicenter of a pandemic? I think there are more likely hypotheses...🤔

I have seen many others suggest the same - a "silver lining" of B.1.1.7 - but I'm not sure I agree. We have to remember that B.1.1.7 isn't a static lineage - it continues down the normal SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path (incl. immune selection).

B.1.1.7 is plenty problematic as is.

Yup - vaccination will definitely take care of B.1.1.7, no problem. Very strong data from Israel here.

However, we need vaccination across the entire world, not just, say, (part of) the US population. It's all one big boat leaking at the corners.

It's confusing to me that anybody can be surprised about this - but Apoorva is absolutely right, it apparently is.

We wrote about the rise of B.1.1.7 in the US back in February - turns out that when it comes to variants, the US isn't actually special. 😱

And by "we will", I mean we'll plausible be in a place where we have vaccinated enough people in a month or two. So why don't we keep fighting the virus in the meantime, instead of igniting a fourth surge just as we're almost across the finish line?

It's dumb. Plain and simple.

Michigan has been the leading edge of the fourth wave in the US and, despite their vaccination efforts, have observed hospitalization go lockstep with cases like previous waves. That's a warning sign - because, again, we haven't vaccinated enough. Yet.

Yes, I expect our vaccination efforts - and pre-existing natural immunity - will help blunt the severity of our next wave, however, B.1.1.7 pulls in the other direction, being 70% more transmissible and 70% more severe.

We are not out of the woods yet.

For the first time since early January, weekly numbers are up (~5%) in San Diego - just as we have big plans for reopenings / indoor events- B.1.1.7 now dominant.

It's important to understand that we have _not_ vaccinated ourselves out of this yet - we will, but we're not there. https://t.co/dYWucySCe0

Correct - people way overestimate the probabilities here. 

Also, while it is absolutely true SARS escaped labs during the epidemic, if we just look at raw numbers, lab escapes caused a handful of infections vs 8k+ natural infections. Vanishingly small.

All of those would be affected - in our paper we discuss a scenario of "pre-circulation" of (potentially) less pathogenic variants.

However, that's where the retrospective testing of ILI samples come in critical - none of them came up positive.

It's unclear to me exactly what might have been frozen vs not, so I didn't make that distinction. But yes, it's possible e.g., whole frozen animals / carcasses may have been involved and I think is the main theory behind the "frozen food". @MarionKoopmans was talking about this.

Okay, so now you're (a) going back to the hypothesis that it was engineered in the lab - the hypothesis that no serious person would consider (your words, not mine), and (b) the logical fallacy of proving a negative.

The week 3-4 plots are excess deaths, not cases. There's a delay, hence deaths only pick up in January.

The case plots I link to are from December.

The preprint you link to is in agreement with what I say, although, they use neighbor-joining trees - I need not say more.

@K_G_Andersen the serology is still on the to do list. The blood bank agreed to provide access to stored samples from Oct-Nov 2019. Needs to be large scale, with standardised assays, to look for smaller pockets that would not be picked up by the surveillance systems we reviewed https://t.co/iTbOXrQpe9

@TheSeeker268 @rowanjacobsen @XingZeng_PhD @kevinpurcell @jbloom_lab 
So it wasn't Shi Zhengli's lab who created this virus or brought it to the market? Maybe it was somebody sharing the same tissue culture room?

Okay, I see.

Anything wrong with these pangolins too?

Of course I do - we perform Gibson assembly in the lab all the time.

But that's irrelevant to my point - if you look at the previous work manipulation CoVs at UNC / WIV, they use restriction enzymes, not Gibson (or other) assembly. Do you have proof they created SARS-CoV-2?

This ended up being almost as long as the report itself. It's technical (in places), but I hope it helps clarify some of the findings and data - especially as they relate to the market being the early epicenter.

I have never been a "top opponent of the lab origin theory" - although I'm sure many see it that way. 

What I am is a "top proponent of the scientific method" - and that's what's key here. The data strongly support one and not the other - I do not engage in conspiracies.

However, as the report concludes, it is extremely unlikely, given much more likely competing hypotheses.

ALL of that was distilled down into our (peer reviewed) "Proximal Origin" paper last year, where we describe that no matter how we looked at the data, it was consistent with natural evolution and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 - with no signs of lab involvement.

So we looked at all the (scientific) evidence, talked to colleagues, learned a lot, and along the way came e.g., CoVs in pangolins carrying the exact same (hence not actually "unusual") receptor binding domain as SARS-CoV-2 that determines the binding to human ACE2.

So why do I think a lab leak is so unlikely? If I was concerned about it in the beginning of 2020? Because, data. 

Back then we had few viruses to compare to, many features of SARS-CoV-2 appeared 'unusual', and I knew well the type of research at WIV (not GOF btw - that was 🇺🇸).

Does this mean the Huanan market wasn't a location for a super spreading event? No - it's very likely super spreading at the market may also have played a role.

So how did it get there? Probably via infected animals - all the pieces (and prior examples) are there.

Now, early efforts were focused on the Huanan market, so there'll be a bias towards identifying cases close to it (although much of this is retrospective, minimizing - but not eliminating - that bias).

In 1854 he figured out how people were getting cholera  in London by plotting on a map those who had died. 

Being keen-eyed, he noticed a water pump in the middle of all the deaths and using simple triangulation he showed it to be the source of the infections.

That part might have been mysterious at the time, but we now know that SARS-CoV-2 transmits efficiently human-to-human (not really true for MERS and SARS, hence it took time to acknowledge), so it's highly plausible those people got infected by people who *did* visit a market.

Going back to the timing described ☝️, we know that the pandemic started ~ mid-November with no, or very limited, transmission prior. 

We also know this to be true from the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data - e.g., early estimates here, that still hold today:

There's a lot of new, extensive, data in there that with some secondary analyses highlight a lot of key points.

Possibly - however, positive samples from e.g., cages may also suggest that the virus samples might have come from animals that they may or may not have sampled (the market was close and disinfected) or may or may no longer have been there at the time of sampling.

That's it for tonight folks - Noodle is telling me it's time for 💤.

Fair enough, however, I *very* clearly state this is unverified - as does the report (hence I included it - because I'm summarizing the report).

While they sampled a lot, it's a teeny-tiny fraction of the true number of potential hosts.

Did you miss the "Critically, however, this is all based on unverified accounts and data" part?

The "A" lineage may be a more appropriate root for the SARS-CoV-2 tree as I previously speculated 🧵👇, but we observe many reversions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, so this question remains open.

SARS-CoV-2 already being "highly adapted to humans" right after it emerged - as has been suggested by e.g., 👇 - was a failed statement from the get go, but we likely also didn't manage to capture early divergence of the virus right after its emergence.

While "B" was (and is) the most dominant lineage, most of the early sequencing was focused on the Huanan market, likely leading to us missing early transmission events - and we almost certainly missed most early post-emergence transmissions.

Interestingly, if we look at SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from early in the outbreak, it splits into the "A" and "B" lineages - the latter being found at the Huanan market and there is one example of "A" at another market. https://t.co/Z8v4fX8Xw1

The report follows up on 168 cases, 93 of whom had been to a market, about half of which visited the Huanan market. The first cases reported at that market were visitors, but overall, more vendors were identified to be COVID-19 cases in the beginning. https://t.co/XbyoTBiTC4

If we look at the early cases, it's clear that many / most of them were associated with the Huanan market, however, several other exposures - including the first known case on December 8 - visited a different market. https://t.co/J6fZTGQjRR

🚨 Combined, these data suggest, but does not prove, that SARS-CoV-2 may have entered the human population at the Huanan market:

- the virus was widespread there
- potential intermediate hosts were there
- goods were sourced from high-risk areas
- early cases were there

457 animal-related samples from 188 individuals of 18 species were also collected and tested - however, all of them were negative.

To look for direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 at the market, 923 environmental samples were collected out of which 69 from the Huanan market were positive for the virus, including from cages. 

The vast majority (~90%) were found in the part of the market where animals were sold. https://t.co/xny2VHyRUe

In addition to the presence of known animals at the market, there is also additional evidence of live animals, including raccoon dogs (very plausible intermediate host) being sold at the market.

The report highlights that a number of shops sold animals at the Huanan market and some of these sourced goods from e.g., Yunnan province where SARSr CoVs capable of using human ACE2 receptors are prevalent (~3% of the population in those areas have antibodies to SARSr CoVs). https://t.co/CvWdoHkzrG

Animals such as mink, pangolins, rabbits, raccoon dogs, civets, ferret badgers, and others are likely intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and breeding of 'wild' animals - including these - is frequent in Hubei and other provinces. https://t.co/2mGeXfJlZ6

Quick note on identifying intermediate hosts / reservoirs. It's been speculated that it's somehow unusual that we haven't found one for SARS-CoV-2 (yet). 

That is not correct - first of all, we don't know if one exist, and second, this type of work often take decades.

We don't know if an intermediate host was also involved in SARS-CoV-2 emergence - and our evidence base looking only at SARS and MERS is small - but it's a well-founded hypothesis. 

Looking at susceptibility across multiple animals, it's clear that many putative hosts may exist. https://t.co/Md3xJXMsJT

It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 has a wide host range - being able to infect many species, ranging from bats to humans and from SARS and MERS we have previously seen that while bats serve as the ultimate reservoir, they emerge via intermediate hosts.

Quick answer - we don't know, however, the report has several lines of evidence that are consistent with, but does not prove, such a scenario.

❓Second question - was the Huanan seafood market the nucleation point of the pandemic? Two things to unpack - did the outbreak _start_ here and/or was the early outbreak _amplified_ there? The answer to the first part is "plausibly" and to the second part "almost certainly".

Combined, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 was not circulating widely prior to the outbreak in December. 

While the resolution isn't sufficient to exclude potential low-level circulation of SARS-CoV-2, recent speculation that there was early widespread transmission is unfounded.

The team also screened tens of thousands of animal samples (serology + qPCR), but again, all samples were negative. 

They also looked at purchases at pharmacies during the pre-outbreak period - all normal, with no increase. https://t.co/3g5F51MNkC

To see if SARS-CoV-2 was circulating prior to December, 2019, they looked at epidemiological data and tested thousands of banked samples using qPCR (active infection) and serology (prior infection) from individuals between Oct - Dec with influenza like illness. 

All negative. https://t.co/ngD6UKb9UW

Two open questions:

1. Did SARS-CoV-2 circulate (widely) prior to the (known) outbreak?
2. Was the Huanan market the nucleation point of the pandemic?

New data in the report answer both of these - "no" and "yes", respectively.

This doesn't mean other hypotheses aren't possible, but they're significantly less likely and not supported by the body of current evidence.

The report found the most likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 was from a bat and through an intermediate host into humans.

Still going through the @WHO data... More to come later, but here's a key point not highlighted. Using both cases or excess deaths, see how the virus moves from North of the Yangtze River and then South/across?

Guess where the Huanan Market is? WIV?

John Snow for the win. https://t.co/WO1EjKf8xm

@K_G_Andersen @WHO Reading the report's annex, negative staff serology is quite a remarkable piece of evidence against lab origins. Either it is a mistake, a lie, or a lab escape is all but ruled out. The true believers are welcome to believe it's a lie, but I doubt we can realistically get closer. https://t.co/FgPoedPgEk

I think a lot of people don't (or don't want to) really understand how the @WHO works or it's mandate. There is so much focus on "WE MUST GO IN TO FULLY INVESTIGATE WIV!", while the more important study is a collaborative endeavor, focusing on the more likely scenarios.

The long-awaited @WHO report on the "Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2" is out.

It's comprehensive, scientific, and provides new insights into early events - while still leaving questions open, with need for further study.

That memo doesn't say anything about how this relates to the origin - the one I link to is current.

It's a vague list of activities at WIV we already knew about ("oh, gosh, they worked on coronaviruses - can you imagine!!!").

It's also littered with scientific falsehoods.

A notion backed by Five Eyes - yet Pottinger, without need to present data, got a prime time spot to accuse China and scientists at WIV of creating coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 without any challenge from @LesleyRStahl @60Minutes?

Yeah, all of this very much smells like February, 2003 - if we can't find actual evidence, we'll just make stuff up. Speculation will make up for what's missing.

Let's hope it doesn't get to that - that's why it's *so* important we stick to actual data and not conjecture.

It also needs to be clear that a huge body of worldwide basic/translational research is funded by the military - think about the amount of DoD / DARPA funding going to academic research in the US - without it being done for "military purposes". It's to support e.g., vaccine dev.

It appears that all these may be closely connected - e.g., intrahost selection for increased ACE2 binding and immune evasion also leading to higher viral loads - may also result in more severe human disease.

@ArisKatzourakis 
I'm not sure I agree on this at the level of 'competition', however, I agree we may be observing selection resulting in pathogenic strains. The key here is the connectedness between pathogenicity and what's being selected for e.g., immune evasion, ACE2 binding, viral loads, etc.

Some of Ioannidis' past comments have suggested limited understanding of disease outbreak analysis (e.g. not accounting for delays in real-time data streams when discussing IFR, focusing on single global average IFR), so it's bizarre to see these 'stay in your lane' comments. https://t.co/svaSAxeAaz

@phylogenomics 
It is worth pointing out that while many believe I’m 💯 dismissing one theory and believe the other is 💯 proven that is far from the truth. However, one has _actual_ evidence and the other none - what I’m strongly objecting against is the continued evidence-free speculation.

It's so obvious when you say it - didn't come across that option during my research. But good idea - why haven't they tried it yet??!!!

I haven't looked deeply at any of the mutations from a functional perspective, however, while there are many mutations in this variant, the constellation of them doesn't seem overly concerning to me.

However, very interesting and it's a reminder of how adaptable this virus is.

Some interesting mutations 'missing' here - including S:N501Y and ORF1a:del3675-77, which are found in the VOCs.

Also interesting convergent mutations- e.g. E484K, H655Y, P681H.

"Phil" and "Doug" - who conquered the world together👇 - also missing (because, very basal lineage). https://t.co/dbs2VO349h

I agree - it depends on what we're trying to use the knowledge for when we talk about 'rate' of evolution. Is it for public health where we might be concerned the virus could defeat e.g., vaccines if we let it "run loose" or is it to have a basic understanding of its evolution?
