Sigh. “Scientists believe if a virus is more transmissible, it tends to be less severe”. Whilst some scientists may believe this, those who study the evolution of virulence (disease severity) generally don’t.

@BenjaminMateus7 
When it spilled over, it is incorrect to say SARS-CoV-2 was "well adapted to humans". We know this because:

1. The emergence of VOCs and human adaptation ongoing
2. The virus can jump between species with no evolution - e.g., mink
3. Pangolin CoVs bind even stronger to hACE2.

The issue isn't that we "guessed wrong" - it's still important to have an updated B.1.351 booster in our arsenal.

The issue is that we may now also need a second one - for B.1.617.2.

And so ♾ - unless we focus on majorly decreasing WW transmission so VOCs less likely to emerge

IMO, the biggest concern with B.1.617.2 isn't B.1.617.2, it's the VOCs we haven't seen yet.

We developed updated boosters for B.1.351, which would likely work just as well for P.1. But B.1.617.2 is a different 'class' of VOC, achieving escape in a different way.

Correct -the main likelihood here doesn't have to do with the "lab" part, it has to do with finding the virus in the first place and working on it secretly prior to a pandemic you don't yet know will happen. And then all of that leading to a super spreading event at a wet market.

Agreed. The science letter comes from the angle that "there's no data, so we can't say either way". That is false - there is plenty of direct data in support of natural emergence, with no data to the contrary. It's a false equivalence. What we're missing is an intermediate host.

"lab leak can be dismissed" and "both zoonosis and lab leak are viable".

I disagree. We have: "lab leak is unsupported/unlikely, with natural emergence supported by data" and the other: "they're equally likely based on a lack of evidence". IMO, the latter is a false equivalence.

This might help - very interesting data from the pangolin CoVs (with near-identical RBD) that bind *human* ACE2 stronger than SARS2.

Strong binding to human ACE2 is nothing unusual at all and SARS2 was definitely not "optimized for human binding".

1977 H1N1 - which was a known virus - was _not_ the result of a lab leak, however, it _was_ the result of human error. Specifically, it was likely linked to a failed vaccine trial with people deliberately being infected and then the virus took off in a pandemic.

It's a bottomless pit of hypotheticals as @MoNscience said. None of it built on anything other than speculation - all of which would require a large complex web of conspiring actors having worked on SARS-CoV-2 before the pandemic. Not impossible, but no evidence for it.

As for WIV and Wuhan, consider this - how likely (or not) was it that Wuhan became ground zero? (with or without lab). Largest city in central China, highly connected, multiple wet markets sourcing from all over China, etc.

It's not the lab leak itself that's highly unlikely - it's everything before, everything after, and the lab leak combined.

SARS escaped once it had been 'pre-selected' for human infectivity and labs were growing high titer viruses. Primary isolate of random virus=very different.

Correct, and totally agree. However, not all equally unlikely, hence not all equally likely to be true.

One we had seen before, during the same month, in a similar setting, with a similar virus. And we had been warned about exactly that event for more than a decade.

Happy to disagree on this point, but I can't see how it's different - e.g., scientist vs animal trader.

Bacteria are living and just need media to grow - one is enough. Viruses are non-living and need to infect cells and replicate, using host machinery, specific receptors, etc.

@angie_rasmussen @mlipsitch @PeterDaszak 
Yeah, that scenario - which is just a very specific version of natural emergence - is highly unlikely, bordering to impossible.

The virus would also have to have been a) picked from a bat, and b) gotten to a wet market to cause a super spreading event. Combined, hugely unlikely.

Sure, A LOT to find out still so 💯 agree. However, data on early cases and excess deaths = not terrible and highly suggestive as all center around Huanan market. qPCR and sequencing from Huanan = good data and very suggestive.

Lab leak = no data, so not poor quality, per se.

I think we have to be very careful with this 'intelligence', which was first reported in Australia back in December of 2019 - plenty of red flags. Maybe somebody broke a foot? Maybe somebody had the flu? WIV is a big place and health seeking behavior in China != US.

The final point to make is that lab leaks have happened only with known viruses - 'known' because they can infect humans. Zoonoses 'select' for human infectivity, unlike random sampling from bats, which doesn't - vast majority of bat viruses can't infect human (cells).

This issue is pretty much universal across bat samples - we had a pretty active 'bat' project, but never managed to isolate anything and getting complete genomes was incredibly hard. I assume the same is true at WIV.

@mlipsitch @PeterDaszak 
To use an example - RaTG13. The genome has low coverage (hence, I assume, it's been updated a few times) = low titer = virtually impossible to grow out (isolate) in tissue culture.

This is the main reason RdRp-based sequencing is used too - near-impossible to get a full genome.

Virus isolate = characterized, however, I think people are *grossly* underestimating how incredibly difficult it is to isolate (grow) a virus out of a primary bat sample. Viruses are typically *very* low titered and samples of poor quality - hence we have very few isolates.

Ripe for conspiracies - and both ways. My main concern is that we end up in a deadlock where there is *zero* incentive to find out how the virus emerged. Presumably, the current version fits the agendas of China/US quite well - once (if) an intermediate host is found, no more.

Christophe, as you mention, the absolute SAR values for B.1.1.7 vs B.1.617.2 are very similar (a little lower) than the early non-B.1.1.7 vs B.1.1.7.

So while B.1.617.2 may likely (inherently) be as transmissible as B.1.1.7, maybe the additional increase is due to breakthroughs?

@TimKell91827640 @ChristoPhraser 
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well. 'First wave' natural immunity may have waned enough to be similar to 1-shot vaccination and I think could to a large extend explain the *increased* transmission rate vs B.1.1.7. India, also high 'first wave' immunity.

One question on SAR - ~1.6x difference between B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2, which is concerning. But from the vaccine data, we also see ~1.6x difference between the two after 1 shot (50% vs 30% eff).

Maybe increased SAR can to a large extend be explained by higher 1shot breakthroughs?

I'll rather focus on the actual research we have ongoing - including data, analyses, and proper interpretation. That also includes not ignoring / misinterpreting / misrepresenting scientific evidence.

Oh, I'm aware of all the solid evidence for SARS-CoV-2 lab escape, including scientists in mines who can, incredibly, pick pandemic viruses out of bat butts, leading to superspreading events in wet markets. 🦇🦠.

Oh, and Wuhan. Of course.

Thanks. It's because she's white and kinda limp when you pick her up... Very fitting.

She also talks. If you call her name she'll come running and start talking to you - mostly it's about naps and the need to have more of those. Or so I think - it's in mandarin.

Sure, definitely bias in this data too - however, if there was a major difference between B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 one might expect to see if already. We don't.

Doesn't mean B.1.617 isn't more transmissible than B.1.1.7, but other data problematic too (likely more so).

Looking back at the early data showing B.1.1.7 was more transmissible than non-B.1.1.7, secondary attack rates were increased across the board. Not so here, suggesting that while B.1.617.2 may be as transmissible as B.1.1.7, it is not more transmissible - at least not in the UK.

A lot of scary looking graphs being shared suggesting  B.1.617.2 may be outcompeting B.1.1.7.

I agree - absolutely a false claim. However, given the insane tweet storm and public statements from @R_H_Ebright in recent days - who I believe is a founding member of @cambridgeWG - (falsely) claiming work at WIV to be GOF, one could excuse him (and others) for being confused.

I am referring to the fact that you have repeatedly characterized NIH work at WIV as GOF - I should have made it clearer what "that" referred to.

You are often described as a Founding Member of CWG, hence I can see where the confusion may come from. E.g., https://t.co/XEOSc3fFG5

@stuartjdneil @R_H_Ebright @GigaGerard @Ayjchan 
Thanks Richard for confirming that your evidence for the NIH supporting GOF research at the WIV is the 2017 paper and the grant abstract.

As the NIH and others have concluded, none of this is GOF.

FWIW, the chimeric viruses are slightly less infectious if anything. https://t.co/jKDAbej6yW

@R_H_Ebright @GigaGerard @Ayjchan 
As Fauci said yesterday, it doesn't matter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it true. You're alleging that the NIH and Fauci are covering up that they funded GOF work at the WIV under an EcoHealth subaward. That allegation needs some hard evidence - otherwise it's libel.

@R_H_Ebright @GigaGerard @Ayjchan 
Your two points are also false - creating 'viruses' that are not present in nature is not GOF. They cloned spike genes from bat coronaviruses into well-established BAC clones and tested ACE2 binding - none led to higher binding. You may disagree with this work, but it's not GOF.

I disagree. You are alleging all of this based on no evidence - "chimeric viruses" can mean a lot of different things. In addition, these viruses are derived from bat coronaviruses and not "SARS viruses" - and certainly not done with the intend to make them more transmissible.

Does this disprove a lab leak? No. However, it disproves there being a "smoking gun" in the FCS and lends further evidence to natural emergence - but it also does not *prove* that scenario. 

To this day, we have yet to see any scientific evidence supporting a lab leak.

So Baltimore's second point is also false, invalidating his hypothesis that the "FCS [...] with its arginine codons [...] was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus".

Baltimore does not provide any evidence to support his hypothesis and the data support a natural origin. https://t.co/sOqqpeqRk4

[#424, 1391507277014650885: Sun May 09 21:36:02 +0000 2021]
R is coded by six different codons, yet the simple single transition "CGA" is only observed in ~0.02% of sequences. The second most 'popular' codon at these sites is "CGT" (a transversion) at 0.11% frequency.

In other words - there is nothing unusual about the codons either.
=====
[#425, 1391507275924180993: Sun May 09 21:36:02 +0000 2021]
🚨Remarkably stable. Specifically, CGG is 99.87% conserved in the first codon and 99.84% conserved in the second. 

This is *very* strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 'prefers' CGG in these positions.
=====
[#426, 1391507274808455168: Sun May 09 21:36:01 +0000 2021]
One final point about the CGG codons in the FCS - if they were somehow "unnatural", we'd see SARS-CoV-2 evolve away from "CGG" during the ongoing pandemic. We have more than a million genomes to analyze, so what do we find if we look at synonymous mutations at the "CGG_CGG" site?

We see CGG multiple times in different ways - here's an example comparing another "PR" stretch between SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV in the N gene. Note how SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 both use CGG, while SARS-CoV-2 uses CGC for the first R, while later R's are coded by CGT or AGA. https://t.co/BKKyOu5UyN

🚨Furthermore, if we go back to the FCoV sequences and compare them to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide level you'll see that FCoV also uses CGG to code for R immediately following the P. The next R is CGA (non-CpG) in FCoV, while it's CGG in SARS-CoV-2 - one nucleotide difference. https://t.co/zDmjMIZTT6

🚨 Despite being rare, however, CGG codons *are* found in all coronaviruses, albeit at low frequency. Specifically, of all arginine codons, CGG is used at these frequencies in these viruses:

SARS: 5%
SARS2: 3%
SARSr: 2%
ccCoVs: 4%
HKU9: 7%
FCoV: 2%

Now, the codons. Here, Baltimore is talking about the two codons coding for the first two arginines (R) following the P - CGG. The CGG codon is rare in viruses because it's an example of an unmethylated "CpG" site that can be bound by TLR9, leading to immune cell activation. https://t.co/2C5d7Keorm

🚨 So Baltimore's first point - that the FCS found in SARS-CoV-2 is somehow unusual - is simply incorrect. FCSs are found in a multitude of different coronaviruses, indels come and go frequently, and the exact (P)RRAR can be found in other coronaviruses.

Importantly, however, in recent month we have started seeing the "P" mutating towards residues creating more optimal furin sites - P681H and, especially, P681R, which can be found in B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.x, suggesting the virus may evolve towards more efficient usage of the site. https://t.co/S1nCxMhYQT

Main issue is that he has no relevant expertise in the very difficult area of science he's trying to address.

It's difficult - I totally get it. If I read Wade's article as a lay person, I'd likely come to the same conclusions - it looks well researched and with seemingly compelling arguments.

The problem is - it's not.

Baltimore's quote *is* shocking - however, not because it's true, but because it's wrong. There's nothing mysterious about the FCS or the codons - anybody who'd care to take a close look at the data would realize this. That, admittedly, requires a little more his "first" look.

It's a general feature we see from the variants - reversion/addition of charged AAs. I don't understand that - typically such mutations would be detrimental, but it seems like SARS-CoV-2 can tolerate them. 🤷

T19R is particularly interesting to me - could be playing a role in both increasing ACE2 affinity and evade Abs since it's in an epitope "super" site.

Potential ACE2 affinity tweaking this far outside the RBD is interesting - but we have seen it in the pango CoVs.

@EricTopol @CDCMMWR 
What's important here is that these numbers are small and this (potential) increased risk of reinfection *doesn't matter* for individuals - the same likely true for e.g., P.1. It only becomes important at the population level and can explain why e.g., B.1.526 rose in frequency.

@EricTopol @CDCMMWR 
The data is too small for firm conclusions, however, for the reinfection data there's ~2x difference between B.1.526(E484K) and non-B.1.526. The trajectory seen from B.1.526 (prior to B.1.1.7) was consistent with ~30-40% increased rate of reinfection - consistent with this study.

Typically I'd 💯 agree with this, but there *are* unfortunately reasons why the lay public need to know about *some* of the variants because they require additional/different mitigation efforts. B.1.1.7 and P.1 come to mind.

Need to be very careful with interpreting this type of data - the true number of reinfections is likely very underreported. So when we say "6%", the real number is likely significantly higher - by how much, we don't know (maybe ~20-30% of total infections during recent RSA wave?)

Agreed. I think especially the point about the importance of “consequences of failure” is often forgotten or ignored.  

The evolution of severe VOCs is one example of such a consequence of failure. “Optimism” may very well lead to inaction.

High attack rates during first waves would likely do that - in places with a lot of standing immunity from early waves, I'd expect B.1.351 and P.1 to be (slightly) more competitive than B.1.1.7.

Mostly B.1.1.7. Vaccination likely bringing down the absolute numbers by now, but wouldn't be expected to change relative proportion.

It's likely going down because of competition from other lineages, as well as drift.

A bunch more reasons to get vaccinated: as more and more are immunized, the number of maskless faces on the right of this chart will steadily increase.

The more we can get transmission down and get vaccination up, the more quickly we will get back to "normal" https://t.co/e5SDjd6pQq

Why do I call them the "Debbie Downers" of the immune system? Because they suppress and modulate immunity so it doesn't get too rowdy🥊 (in an effort to protect against autoimmunity).

Agreed, although I think it's important we separate out individual vs population effects. Having a lot of partial immunity could ⬆️ the average risk of escape for individual transmissions, *however* if it lowers mutational supply (probably does), the overall effect would be ⬇️.

However, a little perspective - in this case comparison to the US - can be helpful.

These plots show 7-day rolling averages of daily cases and deaths.

The situation is dire and immediate action is required in India - however, the US is nowhere near out of this mess yet.

I agree, this is indeed the million dollar question.

However, whatever the answer is, it's *not* just an inherent property of SARS-CoV-2 - we decide the trajectory. 

In a world where there's *much* less transmission, the virus will have fewer opportunities.

"Being smart" is at the level of our country/state/county response - using all indicators and realizing that it's not just about making sure hospitalizations aren't full. We need multi-layered strategies.

I don't think a full escape mutant is on the (near) horizon - the vaccines are ⭐️. However, that's why we need to be smart and drive down transmission (which, the vaccines _will_ help do). But if we see increases in cases -even in the absence of hospitalizations - we need to act.

"Which seems pretty unlikely" - that's the problem. If we have rampant transmission, that "pretty unlikely" is likely going to be "very likely". We already saw what B.1.351 did to AZN - in one single evolutionary jump.

It's playing with fire - and unnecessary if we're smart.

P.1 was quite common in Central Italy (5% of cases nationally, ~10-35% in Central Italy) on Feb 18 and did not increase by Mar 18. B.1.351 was rarely detected in both surveys. 2/9 https://t.co/TbFmuZDPvc

It's confusing to me that anybody can be surprised about this - but Apoorva is absolutely right, it apparently is.

We wrote about the rise of B.1.1.7 in the US back in February - turns out that when it comes to variants, the US isn't actually special. 😱

🧐 My latest investigation looks at US' lagging surveillance for variants.

“We have enough sequencers to sequence SARS-CoV-2 from every case, 100x over,” @K_G_Andersen told me.

But we are sequencing just 1.5% of cases, according to @GISAID posts.

And by "we will", I mean we'll plausible be in a place where we have vaccinated enough people in a month or two. So why don't we keep fighting the virus in the meantime, instead of igniting a fourth surge just as we're almost across the finish line?

Yes, I expect our vaccination efforts - and pre-existing natural immunity - will help blunt the severity of our next wave, however, B.1.1.7 pulls in the other direction, being 70% more transmissible and 70% more severe.

Also, while it is absolutely true SARS escaped labs during the epidemic, if we just look at raw numbers, lab escapes caused a handful of infections vs 8k+ natural infections. Vanishingly small.

Absolutely - which I also describe in the thread, I think we almost certainly missed the very early transmission events. Hopefully we'll be able to find the 'pro' virus in an animal host, allowing us to gain insights into early adaptation and transmission.

In 1854 he figured out how people were getting cholera  in London by plotting on a map those who had died.

What does the report tell us? What new data do we have to see if the Huanan market might have been the early epicenter?

That part might have been mysterious at the time, but we now know that SARS-CoV-2 transmits efficiently human-to-human (not really true for MERS and SARS, hence it took time to acknowledge), so it's highly plausible those people got infected by people who *did* visit a market.

Going back to the timing described ☝️, we know that the pandemic started ~ mid-November with no, or very limited, transmission prior. 

We also know this to be true from the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data - e.g., early estimates here, that still hold today:

Furin cleavage sites are common in CoV, even if this is the first example we have seen in a SARSr-CoV. There are insertions in this very spot in other SARSr-CoVs too, so clearly a highly evolvable site.

Quick note on identifying intermediate hosts / reservoirs. It's been speculated that it's somehow unusual that we haven't found one for SARS-CoV-2 (yet). 

That is not correct - first of all, we don't know if one exist, and second, this type of work often take decades.

We don't know if an intermediate host was also involved in SARS-CoV-2 emergence - and our evidence base looking only at SARS and MERS is small - but it's a well-founded hypothesis. 

Looking at susceptibility across multiple animals, it's clear that many putative hosts may exist. https://t.co/Md3xJXMsJT

It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 has a wide host range - being able to infect many species, ranging from bats to humans and from SARS and MERS we have previously seen that while bats serve as the ultimate reservoir, they emerge via intermediate hosts.

This questions is of course contentious and the report is vague on these points - the US and other countries have been pushing the "lab leak" theory and China for their part have been cagey, at best, when it comes to the involvement of wildlife markets.

❓Second question - was the Huanan seafood market the nucleation point of the pandemic? Two things to unpack - did the outbreak _start_ here and/or was the early outbreak _amplified_ there? The answer to the first part is "plausibly" and to the second part "almost certainly".
=====
[#909, 1377425170063749121: Thu Apr 01 00:58:46 +0000 2021]
Combined, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 was not circulating widely prior to the outbreak in December. 

While the resolution isn't sufficient to exclude potential low-level circulation of SARS-CoV-2, recent speculation that there was early widespread transmission is unfounded.

The team also screened tens of thousands of animal samples (serology + qPCR), but again, all samples were negative.

To see if SARS-CoV-2 was circulating prior to December, 2019, they looked at epidemiological data and tested thousands of banked samples using qPCR (active infection) and serology (prior infection) from individuals between Oct - Dec with influenza like illness. 

All negative. https://t.co/ngD6UKb9UW

- ILI
- Serology
- pharmacy purchases
- qPCR testing on retrospective suspected cases
- Sequencing
- Excess deaths

Two open questions:

2. Was the Huanan market the nucleation point of the pandemic?

The long-awaited @WHO report on the "Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2" is out.

It's comprehensive, scientific, and provides new insights into early events - while still leaving questions open, with need for further study.

That memo doesn't say anything about how this relates to the origin - the one I link to is current.

It appears that all these may be closely connected - e.g., intrahost selection for increased ACE2 binding and immune evasion also leading to higher viral loads - may also result in more severe human disease.

I'm not sure I agree on this at the level of 'competition', however, I agree we may be observing selection resulting in pathogenic strains. The key here is the connectedness between pathogenicity and what's being selected for e.g., immune evasion, ACE2 binding, viral loads, etc.

It's so obvious when you say it - didn't come across that option during my research. But good idea - why haven't they tried it yet??!!!

I heard that somebody told the boat people that the problem would solve itself though, so I think they're waiting for that to happen right now.

I haven't looked deeply at any of the mutations from a functional perspective, however, while there are many mutations in this variant, the constellation of them doesn't seem overly concerning to me.

However, very interesting and it's a reminder of how adaptable this virus is.

@Tuliodna 
Some interesting mutations 'missing' here - including S:N501Y and ORF1a:del3675-77, which are found in the VOCs.

Also interesting convergent mutations- e.g. E484K, H655Y, P681H.

I agree - it depends on what we're trying to use the knowledge for when we talk about 'rate' of evolution. Is it for public health where we might be concerned the virus could defeat e.g., vaccines if we let it "run loose" or is it to have a basic understanding of its evolution?

I don't agree with the former - it's reasonable to describe the 'normal' ticking of the clock (i.e., the avg. subs rate) as being somewhat slow, however, the emergence of novel variants violates the clock. The subs rate also totally ignores indels and recombinations.

Yeah, sorry, should have clarified. The reason why I think E484K should be an MOC has little to do with its increasing frequency, and more with the multiple lines of evidence that it's a problematic mutation. Lineage matters, but I think any lineage with E484K needs tracking.

I expect _some_ of the rise of B.1.526 is driven by reinfections - however, we have no direct evidence of that and, importantly, they may be less severe on average (although, we also don't have any direct evidence to answer that question).

Too many mutations in too little time: B.1.1.7 (chronic infection with active viral replication?)

Assuming the observation is indeed real (I think it is), I think it's a combination of factors. The largest of those might reside outside the spike mutations and has to do with interferon suppression / lowering innate responses (nsp6?). The other, increased receptor binding.

Final point - if we let the virus continue to circulate widely, all bets are off. We'll continue to see severe (local?) outbreaks and new variants will emerge - selection for transmission and immune evasion.

Key points: (1) I don't believe all reinfections will be "mild" or "common cold like". While on average milder, I think there'll be a large spread and new variants will further erode that. (2) There will be many people that can't or won't be vaccinated.

Very good summary, and yes, you're correct Will. I believe we absolutely can make SARS-CoV-2 fade into the background (although I doubt it'll ever be "a common cold"), but that'll require continued aggressive action (what you mention) - at least (or, especially) for now.

"not an appropriate comparison" - that's exactly my point. The assumption you're making is that SARS-CoV-2 will just become a common cold - and you're looking for evidence to reject that (you can't). However, the key question to ask is the opposite - why do you think it will?

Do you have any direct evidence for this? E.g., compare OC43 - leads to common cold in people. Jumps into (naive) apes, also leads to common cold.

SARS-CoV-2 - leads to COVID-19 in both. Also leads to disease in mink, mice (when adapted), etc. OC43 in those animals?

Yeah, but that’s looking at the average substitution rate, which doesn’t take into account indels, masked sites, and most importantly the ‘jumps’ we saw with the variants. Clearly, the level of antigenic escape we have seen with B.1.351 happened much faster than flu.

I know you're ever the optimist Eric - which is good 😉. But yeah, especially the idea about "peak fitness" is fantasy -SC2 may have reached a local maxima, but the fitness landscape is ever changing. It's like declaring "we have reached dry land", only to realize it's quicksand.

@WilliamBHoenig @EricTopol @DhruvKhullar @NewYorker @McLellan_Lab 
It's unclear what exactly the article is saying - but to me it says that SARS2 is likely just a newly emerged OC43. We have no evidence for that and it's a premature conclusion.

To your point, however, I do believe SARS-CoV-2 can fade more into the background. With hard work.

Claim 3 - the virus will become less severe. Again, the evidence we have seen so far show the opposite - e.g., B.1.1.7. That may well change in the future, but the common idea that it'll "evolve towards lower virulence" is context dependent and unsupported by evidence or theory.

Claim 2 - antibody escape will lead to lower ACE2 affinity. The evidence we have to date show this to be the opposite.

Not to be a party pooper, but none of this is supported by evidence - and the three key points are false/unsupported. 

Claim 1 - the virus has reached peak fitness. No data to support that and evidence from e.g., ccCoVs would suggest the opposite. E.g.: https://t.co/eMMi2Gu1xQ

From an immunology perspective, I can see the attraction. However, nothing about SARS-CoV-2 looks like ccCoV to me -whether it be the extreme host- or tissue-tropism, or it's ability to infect damn near any organ. I don't believe the same is true for ccCoVs. Also, SARS. And MERS.

Agreed - in fact, I'm not convinced that whatever it is that makes B.1.1.7 so transmissible is necessarily (exclusively) linked to mutations in the spike. Sure, maybe the spike mutations play *a* role, but are they wholly responsible? I'm not so sure.

Key here is - we have no idea what 'impactful' mutations might look like in a virus that already has E484K - or other mutations.

It's like trying to play million-dimensional chess - and while it's plausible we can checkmate SARS-CoV-2 (with vax), I highly doubt we have. Not yet.

Totally agree - it might be true that SARS-CoV-2 has found a local maxima for fitness, but that landscape ever changing.

Plus, NL63 - while very different - uses ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect very many animals with different ACE2. All tells you it's highly tolerant to mutations.

Thanks - these numbers should be taken with a massive grain of salt though, as there's a very large bias in the US towards specifically sequencing B.1.1.7. So these numbers are over-inflated. Better estimates of prevalence (although, also not perfect): https://t.co/OGl4wb2vzf

None of these look particularly interesting to me from a VOI/VOC standpoint - we're just looking at normal virus dynamics where things go 📈 and 📉. You could take a bunch of different lineages and they'd look similar - some would rise, some would fall - just expected dynamics.

I'm glad to see @CDCgov making good recommendations.

However, it's key that we communicate that these are *short* term recommendations until we get SARS-CoV-2 under much better control, with larger numbers of people vaccinated. Once we're there, these requirements will relax. https://t.co/ItPwbJztmR

It’s true that there are scientists on that “letter”, however, there are no experts and it’s certainly not “based on science”. In fact, it’s hard to find anybody with relevant experience who signed. Unlike the group established under WHO (all experts with relevant experience).
